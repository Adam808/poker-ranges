This is a simple script that defines poker hand ranges for 6-max play. It automatically
updates your position as you enter hands. It prints "True" if the hand is in the
defined raising range for the position and "False" if the hand is in the folding range
for the position. It also specifies calling and raising ranges for the big blind.
